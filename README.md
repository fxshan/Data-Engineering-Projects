This repository is a collection of data engineering projects covering a variety of topics, including Python, SQL, Shell scripting, ETL, Airflow, EDW, DBA tasks, NoSQL, BI solutions, and Big Data with Hadoop and Spark.  

## Project Recap
### Python Project <a href="#readme-top">🔝</a>
- Extracted and transformed global banking market-cap data into multiple currencies (USD/GBP/EUR/INR) using Python and Pandas.
- Built automated ETL pipelines with logging, stored outputs in CSV and SQL tables, and implemented database queries to serve localized market-cap values for regional teams.  

### RDBMS Project <a href="#readme-top">🔝</a>
- Designed a centralized relational database for a nationwide coffee shop expansion by integrating data from POS systems, supplier databases, spreadsheets, and CRM exports.
- Built normalized schemas, ERDs, and SQL database objects across PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- Delivered reusable views and materialized views to support executive analytics and operational reporting.

### Linux Shell Scripting Project <a href="#readme-top">🔝</a>
- Developed an automated Linux backup script (backup.sh) to detect and archive encrypted password files updated within the last 24 hours.
- Implemented timestamp-based file scanning, compression logic, and safe path handling using Bash.
- Scheduled the script via cron for daily execution, improving reliability and eliminating manual backup errors.

### Database Administration Project <a href="#readme-top">🔝</a>
- Designed, configured, and administered multi-platform database environments using PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Datasette.
- Performed user/role management, privilege grants, backup & recovery operations, and optimized query performance through indexing and storage-engine analysis.
- Built views, restored datasets, and benchmarked query improvements to ensure reliable, efficient data access across systems.
