## Project Scenario
For this project you will assume the role of database administrator at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project where you need to setup, test and optimize the data platform.  The platform includes various on-premises database servers like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and an open-source tool such as Datasette, as well as optional cloud-based databases like IBM DB2.  Your job is to configure, tune, secure, backup and monitor those databases and keep them running at peak performance.
