## Project Scenario
You are a data engineer hired by a solid waste management company. The company collects and recycles solid waste across major cities in the country of Brazil. The company operates hundreds of trucks of different types to collect and transport solid waste. The company would like to create a data warehouse so that it can create reports according to their requirements.

## Exercise 1: Design a data warehouse

### Task 1: Design the dimension table MyDimDate
Write down the fields in the MyDimDate table in any text editor, one field per line. The company is looking at a granularity of day, which means they would like to have the ability to generate the report on a yearly, monthly, daily, and weekday basis.
